# Teampass

Teampass is a stateless password manager.

Experimental.

## Motivation

* Personnal on-the-go.
For passwords you might need on a new computer.
No storage, no cloud sync.

* Small teams sharing accounts. 
Many services are used with a single account, and people just copy passwords around in chats, emails, or documents. With teampass, you share a team password in person once, and have all other passwords generated.

Just a single password to remember.
Always available on the web, or as a static page to download.

## Usage

* Pick a master password.

* Use the different generated passwords for different accounts.

Need a different group of people? Just decide on another master passphrase with that group.

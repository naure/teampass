# Teampass

Teampass is a stateless password manager.

## Motivation

* Personnal.
For passwords you might need on a new computer.
No storage, no cloud sync. Just a single password to remember.

* Small teams sharing accounts. 
Many services are used with a single account.

Always available on the web, or as a static page to download.

Pick a master password.
Use the different passwords for different accounts.

New group? Just decide on another master passphrase for that group.
